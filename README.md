# Blogr

Blogr is a rails engine which adds very basic blogging functionality to any existing rails app. The functionaliy includes:
- Multiple authors
- Publishing/drafting posts
- RSS

The engine has no styling whatsoever and so I would recommend cloning this repo and modifying the engine to suit your needs before adding it as a gem to your rails application.

## Setup your own blogging engine
First clone this repository:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:GAFuller/blogr.git yourappname_blog
```

Remove this repository as its origin:
```
$ git remote rm origin
```
